Please join us for our wedding ceremony and celebration in Ohio on Sunday, May 26, 2019. For more information about the wedding or to RSVP please visit our website using your customized link <a href="{{host_url}}?user={{username}}">{{host_url}}?user={{username}}</a>
<br/><br/>
There is more information about lodging on the website, but because of the remoteness of the wedding venue and the holiday weekend we were told lodging fills up fast, so planning your lodging early is suggested.
<br/><br/>
Because of the limited lodging in the area and the activities we are planning around the wedding, RSVP's sooner then later would be appreciated We will send out a reminder invitation email with a deadline for RSVPs early next year.
<br/><br/>
If you have any questions or concerns, please post them on the site's question forum. Looking forward to seeing everyone!
<br/><br/>
Much Love,
<br/>
Dave & Courtney
